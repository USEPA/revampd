        <p>Air Markets Program Data (AMPD) provides public access to current and historical Clean Air Markets data from 1995 onward. The data is collected from power plants and other sources that report to EPA's Clean Air Markets Division under several market-based regulatory programs. Click <a href="https://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/clean-air-markets-programs">here</a> to see a list of our current and retired programs.</p>

        <p>Hourly, quarterly, ozone season and annual emissions are available at the unit and monitoring location levels, as well as data on allowances held, state allowance budgets, and allowance transactions.</p>
        <p>Allowance trading programs require sources to hold allowances to cover their emissions. Generally, one allowance equals one ton of emissions. Allowances can be traded or saved for use in the future. At the end of the year, EPA makes sure facilities are in compliance by reconciling allowances and emissions.</p>
        <p>Not all data recorded is directly linked to Clean Air Markets Division Programs. Electric utility data are reported to EPA and the Department of Energy though several complementary programs. AMPD feeds some of these other databases. It is important to note that the data may not match because the purposes are different.</p>
